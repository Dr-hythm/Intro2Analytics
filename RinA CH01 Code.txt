# In the following code q() is commented out so that

# Listing 1.1 - A Sample R session
 	 
# Assigning multiple values as vector to the variable 'age' using the combine function
age <- c(1, 3, 5, 2, 11, 9, 3, 9, 12, 3) 
# Assigning multiple numeric values as a vector to the variable 'weight' using the combine c() function
weight <- c(4.4, 5.3, 7.2, 5.2, 8.5, 7.3, 6, 10.4, 10.2, 6.1)
# Passing weight as a parameter to the mean() function
# Other parameters that can be included in mean() are, trim and na.rm
# By default trim = 0  and na.rm =FALSE
mean(weight)
# Passing weight as a parameter to the the standard deviation sd() function
# Other parameter that can be included in sd() is na.rm
sd(weight)
# Passing age and weight as an argument in correlation cor() function
cor(age, weight)
# Passing age and weight as an argument in plot() function for displaying a scatter plot with age in x-axis and weight in y-axis
plot(age, weight)
# q()

# Listing 1.2 - An example of commands used to manage
# the R Workspace. Change the next line to one of your 
# directories

# Change the current working directory to "C:/myprojects/project1"
setwd("C:/myprojects/project1")
# Change the number of digits to be displayed after a decimal point to 3, as by default it is set to 7, using options() method
options()

# Genrate 20 random deviates and assign to x
# and generate summary and a histogram for that data
x <- runif(20)
summary(x)

# Save the command history and the current workspace in a files
savehistory()
